# API Fetching Website


## Description
- #### This project is meant to test and showcase the ability of calling an API and showcasing it on a website. With this, I decided to go with a food instruction API that utilizes useStates and the client side to show meals in a list. 

## Usage
- Home page
    - To add a meal, you just press the Add Random Meal Button to get a random meal, and then the more you press it the more meals you get. Furthermore there is a accordian style of cards for each meal, where it will show instructions on how to make that specified meal.  
## Prerequisites 
- Next JS
```bash
    - npx create-next-app ____Folder_Name___
```

## Quick Installation/deployment
- install project from github (code-->zipped file)
- unzip file
- do npm i in terminal
- npm run dev
- go to http://localhost:3000 for the home Page
